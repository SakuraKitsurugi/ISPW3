## Task:
**Develop an RSA algorithm encryption/decryption system. The prime numbers p and q should not exceed 1000.**
- - [x] Input of initial data: two primary numbers p and q, initial plaintext x.
- - [x] Finding the parameters required for encryption/decryption algorithms. Public key finding, Euclidean algorithm implementation, Euclidean advanced algorithm implementation.
- - [x] Encryption of the plaintext x.
- - [x] Save ciphertext y and public key (n,e) in the:
  - - [X] File system.
  - - [ ] Database.
- - [x] Read ciphertext y from the file system/database.
- - [x] Decrypt ciphertext y. The decryption method requires an additional method that has n to find the two prime numbers. When you have the primes numbers system can find the value of Φ[n]. Having Φ[n] and e, can compute the private key.
